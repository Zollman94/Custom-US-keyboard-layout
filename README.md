# My custom US - Czech Layout for keyboard.
I got tired of constantly switching between czech and us leyout when i do programming but need to keep commenting in my native lenguage so i came with my own layout for czech programmers. Maybe someone will use it but i have this repo public so i don't have to login when i need to download to new machine. Bellow are screens of buttons layout.
