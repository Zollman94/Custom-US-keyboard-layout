# My custom US - Czech Layout for keyboard.

I have created a custom keyboard layout for programmers who frequently switch between English and Czech. This layout allows for easy commenting in Czech while maintaining the convenience of the US layout for programming.

## Installation:

1. Download the repository as a zip file.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file.
3. Run the `setup.exe` file.
4. Change the keyboard layout in the Windows settings under Time & Language > Language & Regions.
